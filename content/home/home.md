description="Based in Copenhagen ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°, I work at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.sumup.com/'>SumUp</a>, a fintech company empowering small businesses. Our vision is to build a world where anyone can create a thriving business through accessible tools and technology. <br/>A specialized generalist at heart, I bring a unique blend of expertise across backend systems, mobile development, and infrastructure. Over my career, I've led teams of all sizesâ€”from hands-on coding to scaling engineering groupsâ€”always anchored in the 3P framework: <strong>People, Product, Process</strong>.<br/>I'm driven by cultivating high-performing teams that embrace iterative improvement, psychological safety, and purpose-driven work. Whether refining agile workflows or mentoring future leaders, my goal is to build environments where both products <em>and</em> people thrive."
