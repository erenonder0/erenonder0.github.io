This project is a lightweight utility developed to obfuscate <span class="inline-code">.exe</span> file extensions by inserting the Braille Pattern Blank character (Unicode U+2800) just before the  <span class="inline-code">.exe</span> suffix. The primary objective is to disguise the true nature of executable files in environments where basic file extension spoofing is relevant for educational, research, or cybersecurity awareness purposes.
