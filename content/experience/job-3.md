## Google Developer Student Club - Event and Organization Coordinator

I served as the event and organization coordinator at the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), which represents Google in Elazığ, and played an active role in organizing various events related to technology, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and Google products.

In this role, I brought together students interested in technology and software development by organizing various technical events, seminars, and workshops. I was actively involved in the planning process of the events, including content planning, inviting speakers, and time management.

During this process, I improved my organizational skills and gained experience in team collaboration, problem-solving, and community communication. I also had the opportunity to contribute to the development of students who wanted to learn about technology. This role enhanced my competence in organizing sustainable and impactful events under a community-led structure.
