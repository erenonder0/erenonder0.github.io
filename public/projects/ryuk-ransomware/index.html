        <p>This project was developed to safely simulate and analyze how real-world ransomware operates within a controlled environment.
Written in C#, this simulation uses AES encryption to lock files and places itself in system startup, accurately modeling the behavior of actual ransomware and providing a reliable test environment.</p>
<p>Note: This project was created solely for academic and educational purposes and must never be executed on real systems.</p>
