              Cyber Anatolia Communities - Event and Organization Coordinator I have been serving as an event and organization coordinator under the umbrella of the Cyber Anatolia Communities. This volunteer-based initiative brings together more than 35 university clubs and over 17,000 students across Turkey, aiming to raise cybersecurity awareness among students, promote knowledge and experience sharing, enhance individuals&rsquo; technical skills, and contribute to the development of conscious professionals in the field.
As part of this role, I actively participated in the planning processes of various events such as winter camps, online activities, and an international CTF competition held between Turkey and the United Kingdom.
I took responsibility in multiple stages of these events, including content development, scheduling, communication, and coordination. Through this experience, I gained significant skills in organizational planning, time management, and team coordination. It also strengthened my ability to work with large-scale communities, take initiative, and contribute meaningfully to the cybersecurity ecosystem.
